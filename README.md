## Lecture Best Practices

(This is a working document - submit a pull request to add or change!)

Lectures make up a significant part of our classes and are important to get right. We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what works and what doesn’t when it comes to exposing students to concepts through our lectures. Here are some key insights.

+ The energy you put in to a lecture determines the energy you get back from your students. Come in fresh!
+ Read over the ‘script’ a few times in the days leading up to the lecture. Some teachers find it helpful to take separate notes that will guide them, as opposed to only sticking to the longer script.

+ Identify two/three key points and put them in student friendly language. As you write the script what are two or three things students HAVE to remember for the next day, for the next week, for the rest of their coding journey. How can you put it in language students understand? How can you make it sticky? Make an anchor chart or write your key points on the board so that you remember and students remember to reference them often

+ Practice/Hone the ‘hook’ : What is the thing that’s going to make this lesson relevant/interesting? Like a good storyteller, is there a way you can grab the students’ attention early on?
+ Unless students are following along (code-along style), encourage students to go “half-mast” with their laptops, to encourage students to focus. You can have an attention getting signal (countdown from 5, "if you can hear me clap once", hands up, mouths off) when it's time to bring students together after group work.
+ Try to vary the interactivity of your lecture. You shouldn’t go more than 8-10 minutes without taking a break for students to stop and try the code out for themselves with a mini-challenge.
+ The more you can make your lecture *relevant* the better. That means getting to know your students and then using that information in your lectures. (“Ok, Mikey loves playing soccer. Let’s make an array of all the soccer teams he’s a fan of”). This is especially helpful for students lacking engagement.
+ Checks for understanding
	+ Talk to a partner and explain.
	+ Use your arm as a meter for how well you understand.
	+ Thumbs-Up, Thumbs-Down
	+ Use mini-whiteboards to get whole class participation on questions.
	+ Cold calling (use this carefully as you don’t want to put students who are struggling on the spot)
	+ Ask for volunteers to repeat back the concept. 

+ Pause for synthesis at various points in the lecture:
What is this? Why is this important? Why did we do it like this? Can you summarize this? How could we add to it?
+Summarize before each break and at the end of the day
	+$2 Summarizer: With each word worth 10 cents, write a $2 summary of the learning from the
lesson. Optional to include key vocab students must use (string, datatype, float). (or you can have them write a haiku, a poem etc)
	+Aha! and Huh?: On notecards, students write one "Aha!" moment they had and one "Huh?" thing they need to work on that night. (Be sure to address the common Huh theme during the next class).
	+Quick Talk: Students move around the room until you say stop. They high five with someone next to them and are now a pair. If you are the partner who lives the farthest from Flatiron you are Partner A. Partner A. Take 30 seconds to explain (key point 1). Partner B, explain (keypoint 2). Everyone find a new partner. Partner A is the person who has the closest birthday to today. Partner A, share one thing that still confuses you. Partner B offer any advice.
	+Error Analysis: Show an code with an error on the board. Students have two minutes to figure out a. what the error is and b. how to fix it
	+The Three Minute 3: Minute 1 - in groups summarize the key points in their own words. Minute 2- in groups discuss their own ideas about the key points. Students should write their own connections and thoughts (This reminds me of, one way I remember this, this relates to another topic by) Minute 3 -Students should list questions they still have or concepts they are still unclear about

+ Asking deliberate questions is important. [Here is a short guide](http://medicine.wright.edu/sites/default/files/page/attachments/QuestionTemplates.pdf) of different types of questions to try to include in your lecture.
