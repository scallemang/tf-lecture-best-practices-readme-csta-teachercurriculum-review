## Lecture Best Practices

(This is a working document - submit a pull request to add or change!)

Lectures make up a significant part of our classes and are important to get right. We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what works and what doesn’t when it comes to exposing students to concepts through our lectures. Here are some key insights.

+ The energy you put in to a lecture determines the energy you get back from your students. Come in fresh!
+ Read over the ‘script’ a few times in the days leading up to the lecture. Some teachers find it helpful to take separate notes that will guide them, as opposed to only sticking to the longer script.
+ Walk throught the curriculum with someone else - a fellow teacher maybe!
+ Practice/Hone the ‘hook’ : What is the thing that’s going to make this lesson relevant/interesting? Like a good storyteller, is there a way you can grab the students’ attention early on?
+ Unless students are following along (code-along style), encourage students to go “half-mast” with their laptops, to encourage students to focus.
+ Try to vary the interactivity of your lecture. You shouldn’t go more than 8-10 minutes without taking a break for students to stop and try the code out for themselves with a mini-challenge.
+ The more you can make your lecture *relevant* the better. That means getting to know your students and then using that information in your lectures. (“Ok, Mikey loves playing soccer. Let’s make an array of all the soccer teams he’s a fan of”). This is especially helpful for students lacking engagement.
+ Checks for understanding
	+ Talk to a partner and explain.
	+ Use your arm as a meter for how well you understand.
	+ Thumbs-Up, Thumbs-Down
	+ Use mini-whiteboards to get whole class participation on questions.
	+ Cold calling (use this carefully as you don’t want to put students who are struggling on the spot)
	+ Ask for volunteers to repeat back the concept. 

+ Pause for synthesis at various points in the lecture:
What is this? Why is this important? Why did we do it like this? Can you summarize this? How could we add to it?

+ Check out [this great resource from Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/teach/instructionalstrategies/lectures.html)

+ Asking deliberate questions is important. [Here is a short guide](http://medicine.wright.edu/sites/default/files/page/attachments/QuestionTemplates.pdf) of different types of questions to try to include in your lecture.
